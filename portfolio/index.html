    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Below is a list of apps and projects I've made.
      Where possible, I have included gif files. This way you can quickly view
      the app or project without having to download them.</p>

      <h2>Fite Time</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.fitetime.app">Fite Time</a> is an iOS application for Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). It provides upcoming event schedules, scorecards,
      fight cards details, and live results update. </p>
    <p> For this application, I built the entire backend plus client. Backend was built on AWS products, such as
      DynamoDB and Lambda functions. The newer portion of the app uses Google
      cloud products. For example, user score section involves both the Realtime and Firestore database. Cloud
      functions are used to manage background work.
    </p>
    <p>This application was written in both Objective-C and Swift.
      Some of the iOS libraries used are core data, notifications, and core animations/graphics.
      This app is available to download in the app store.
    </p>
    <p>Below are screenshots and gif of the app.</p>

    <h2>Learn Basic Japanese</h2>
    <p>This untitled application was born from my desire to learn Japanese and my frustration
      with Duolingo. I was an avid user of Duolingo, which attempts to turn learning a new language into a game. However, in the end I find it to be an ineffective way of
      learning Japanese for me. I built an app that helps me learn Japanese the hard way, and it may get released into the app store
      in the future.</p>
      <p>The application is essentially a powered up deck of flash cards. Tapping on the card plays the sound of the Hiragana
        or Katakana character. There's also a section on practicing writing the characters. This is important
        because writing helps to reinforce learning new characters. It is part of the learning process. Please look below and note the stroke order on the characters.
        I spent a lot of time making those files and I think they turned out well!

      <p>Below are the screenshots and gif of the project.</p>

        <h2>Theme Change</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates how to change themes in an iOS app.
          There is a light, dark, and Dubs(Warriors Colors) mode. Ok, I admit the Dubs mode color combination looks less than appealing in the app,
          but the purpose was to demonstrate the change of theme. Below is a gif.
          You can find the code in my <a href="https://github.com/kyleshin/demoTheme">GitHub</a> page.</p>

        <h2>Custom View Controller Transition Animations</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates how to perform custom view controller transition animations.
          The animation from first to second VC is non-interactive. The return from second to first
          VC is interactive. Below is a gif. Photo taken during my Hawaii vacation in Honolulu.
          You can find the code in my <a href="https://github.com/kyleshin/Present-Image">GitHub</a> page.

      <h2>Slide Up Deck</h2>
        <p> This project is actually something I'm using in Fite Time. The code will be posted on GitHub, as soon
          as a few things are cleaned up. Essentially this is quite a popular feature we've seen in many apps. The
          presenting controller uses a custom presentation view controller to present the presented view controller.
          This allows us to give it the look of a slide up deck of card, where we can place buttons or labels in the card.
          The card deck is animated and responds to pan gesture. The way I built this, the animation isn't an interactive
          view transition(unlike the above project). The dragging animation takes place within the presented view controller.
          The dismiss animation is part of the custom transition animation.
        </p>

      <h2>Progress Bar Animation</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates how to animate a progress bar. The animation here is set to
          decrement from 10 seconds to 0 seconds. Animation is performed every second over 1 second.
          The animation technique could easily be used for something more discrete, such as a step
          counter (tracking walk progress throughout the day) or download progress. Below is a gif.

    <p>Below is a list of apps and projects I've made.
      Where possible, I have included gif files. This way you can quickly view
      the app or project without having to download them.</p>

      <h2>Fite Time</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.fitetime.app">Fite Time</a> is an iOS application for Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). It provides upcoming event schedules,
      fight cards details, and live results update. In an upcoming version, user will also be able to score
    the fights as it unfolds. </p>
    <p> For this application, I built the entire backend plus client. Backend was built on AWS products, such as
      DynamoDB and Lambda functions. The newer portion of the app uses Google
      cloud products. For example, user score section involves both the Realtime and Firestore database. Cloud
      functions are used to manage background work.
    </p>
    <p>This application uses both Objective-C and Swift.
      This project uses core data, notifications, and custom animations.
    </p>
    <p>Below are sample screen shots and gifs of the project.</p>

    <h2>Learn Basic Japanese</h2>
    <p>This untitled application was born from my desire to learn Japanese and my frustration
      with Duolingo. I was an avid user of Duolingo, which tries to turn learning a new language into a game. However in the end I find it to be an ineffective way of
      learning Japanese. I built an app that helps me learn Japanese, the hard way, and it may get released into the app store
      in the future.</p>
      <p>The application is essentially powered up flash card. Tapping on the card plays the sound of the Hiragana
        or Katakana character. There's also a section on practicing writing the characters. This is important
        because writing helps to reinforce learning new characters. Please note the stroke order on the characters.
        I spent a lot of time making those files and I think they turned out well!

      <p>Below are sample screen shots and gifs of the project.</p>

        <h2>Theme Change</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates how to change themes in an iOS app.
          There is a light, dark, and dubs(Warriors Colors) mode. Below is a gif.
          You can find the code in my GitHub.</p>

        <h2>Custom View Controller Transition Animations</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates how to perform custom view controller transition animations.
          The animation from first to second VC is non-interactive. The return from second to first
          VC is interactive. Below is a gifs. Photo taken during my Hawaii vacation in Honolulu.
          You can find the code in my GitHub.

        <h2>Progress Bar Animation</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates how to animate a progress bar. The animation here is set to
          decrement from 10 seconds to 0 seconds. Animation is performed every second over 1 second.
          The animation technique could easily be used for something more discrete, such as a step
          counter (tracking walk progress throughout the day) or download progress. Below is the gif.

## First Ever Post

While I have years of experience producing iOS applications, when it comes to websites
my experience is nil. Even though the site design is very minimal, I'm very **happy**
to finally launched my first site on GitHub Pages.

One reason I decided to launch this blog is to force myself to learn some basic web programming and designs, but also I wish to produce a decent blog posts chronically how I became an iOS developer. There are things that an experienced developer takes for granted, which a beginner would sometimes find confusing or struggles with.
I'm hoping to highlight some of my early struggles and solutions. Perhaps these future posts
might help some beginner with his/her journey.

Also I might occasionally blog about other things that may interests me, such as video games or
sports. Since it is a personal site, I let the blogs evolve organically ðŸ¤Ÿ.
